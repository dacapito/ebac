			<h1> Estimated Blood Alchool Content </h1> 
		This app calculates the Estimated Blood Alcohol Content (EBAC) known your weight, and what you have drunk. </p>
	
		Here I made use of the well established Widmark formula in the expression presented in [Ki-05]. For simplicity of use, the beverages are divided in 3 major groups: light drinks (LD, beer and similar, about 5% vol content of alcohol), regular drinks (RD, wine, 12%) and heavy drinks (HD, whisky and friends, about 40%). For each kind, a standard quantity for each take is defined: 250ml for LD, 125ml for RD and 30ml for HD. In all cases, this corresponds to an alcohol intake of approximately 10g per unit. The user is required to provide his/her weight (in Kg), gender , the number of 'takes' per each beverage type and the average time since the drinks were taken (in hours). </p>
	
		The app calculates the EBAC and provides a comment in different colors. Below 0.5 g/L it is OK (in a majority of european countries but mind: NOT everywhere), whereas between 0.5 and 0.8 g/L it reminds you that driving is forbidden (in many countries, see Ref.[wiki-1]). Between 0.8 and 1.5 g/L it  driving can be a criminal offense (and, at any rate, driving at these EBAC levels is forbidden even in the more tolerant states), between 1.5 and 2.4 g/L the level is dangerous for health and above 2.4 g/L the liver capability of processing blood alcohol is surpassed and the health risk is really severe. </p>
	
		It is worth to stress here that this code possess inevitable simplifications and approximations. It should thus be considered ad a rough indicator and in no case constitutes a substitute for the ethylometer. And, at the end, remember that no drinking at all is the best choice for the driver. </p>
